#library_system

To run this program just transfer the files into your IDE and run the program. There will be instructions for each step of the way :)

I made this program for my friend who love's reading. She wanted to be able to add our own books and such thus the feature to add books to the library.

This project is incomplete and runs in the terminal only for now. I would like to continue adding onto this program by implementing a GUI and I would like to
use google books API to grab data on books and use those as the books in our library. This is just one of the many features i want to add but for now I will 
have to put this project on pause to continue working on nmy website.
